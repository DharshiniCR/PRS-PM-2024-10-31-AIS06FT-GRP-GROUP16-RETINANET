## SECTION 1 : PROJECT TITLE
## Portfolio Management System

---

## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

This project involves building a stock portfolio management system using machine learning techniques for optimization and prediction. It combines clustering, risk-return optimization, and time-series forecasting, all integrated into an interactive Flask web application. The system empowers everyday investors with accessible, data-driven financial insights for better decision-making.

Key Components:​

1.Portfolio selection and construction using clustering algorithm : K-means, Apriori ​

2.Portfolio optimization through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA),  Simulated Annealing (SA)​

3. Forecasting portfolio weights using LSTM​

Goals:​

A web-based product for real-time portfolio monitoring and management.​
